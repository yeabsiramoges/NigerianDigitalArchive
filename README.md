# Nigerian Digital Archive
Working on the Omeka platform to create a website hosting a digital archive of Nigerian tech history duing the PC Boom. 

## Project Overview

Within the Digital Humanities Lab, this UROP aims to create an archive of Nigerian technology to tackle the typical view of Africa held outside of the continent. Nigeria had been a part of the computer boom since very early on yet the nation and those within it that spearheaded the movement from within don't get mentioned as having been at the forefront of the developments as they were. This archive will show the rich history for Nigeria in the pc field and the many developments that came from the nation, including news stories and interviews.


## Personal Responsibilities & Goals

I will be working on creating the actual website where the archive will be hosted, as well as learning the history while going along with the project. I will be working on the Omeka platform, used for building the website, as well as working with the site metadata to create the archive pages in an easy to access and nice to view manner. 


## Personal Statement

As an African asylee, I have encountered many backwards views of the nature of the continent and how underdeveloped it is as a whole. Many have discounted the many contributions that the continent and its constituent nations have made to the world as a whole and its various movements, especially in tech. I wanted to work on this project as I believe that this is but a part of the new movement, the rise of Africa and its stature across the globe. I want to help purvey the idea that Africa is more than what meets the eye.
